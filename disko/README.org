#+TITLE: Disko for Guix
#+AUTHOR: Dmitry Klementiev

* Disclaimer

Development in progress. Inspired by nix-community's disko flake

* Why stdout instead of runtime commands running?

I used the standard output to test the commands, and then I was too lazy to rewrite the code afterwards

* Roadmap

- [ ] Root directory is hardcoded (=/mnt=). Get it from CLI, then put to ENV and take in procedures with =getenv= like =INSTALLATION_ROOT= env variable
- [ ] Priority
  : Translated with DeepL
  If you put the vfat partition in front of the root partition,
  disko will try to mount the vfat partition in /mnt/boot/efi,
  which does not exist because it is mounted in front of the root partition.
- [ ] More readable source code (:
