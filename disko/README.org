#+TITLE: Disko for Guix
#+AUTHOR: Dmitry Klementiev

* Disclaimer

Development in progress. Inspired by nix-community's disko flake

* Roadmap

1. [ ] Root directory is hardcoded (=/mnt=). Get it from CLI, then put to ENV and take in procedures with =getenv= like =INSTALLATION_ROOT= env variable
2. [ ] Priority
   : Translated with DeepL
   If you put the vfat partition in front of the root partition,
   disko will try to mount the vfat partition in /mnt/boot/efi,
   which does not exist because it is mounted in front of the root partition.
